# **Project Description**
**BMW Car Price Analysis & Prediction**

This project focuses on uncovering patterns and relationships in BMW‚Äôs global car sales data from 2010 to 2024. The primary objective is to analyze how different factors such as model, region, color, engine size, and transmission type influence both **sales performance** and **pricing behavior**.  

The dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore market dynamics, evaluate product performance across regions, and develop a simple predictive model for price estimation.  
Through detailed visualization and statistical analysis, this project aims to generate actionable business insights for automotive market strategy.

# **Goals**
1. **Explore** BMW sales trends and model popularity across global regions.
2. **Identify** how car features (e.g., engine size, color, transmission, fuel type) affect price and sales volume.
3. **Visualize** correlations between market regions, customer preferences, and price distribution.
4. **Predict** car price using regression techniques as an optional modeling component.

# **Proposed Dataset:**

**Source:** Kaggle - [BMW Worldwide Sales Records (2010‚Äì2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmadrazakashif/bmw-worldwide-sales-records-20102024)

The dataset contains BMW‚Äôs sales and specifications data across multiple regions worldwide. It includes over 30,000 entries and features such as car model, engine size, year, region, transmission type, fuel type, mileage, color, price, and sales volume.

# Example of the dataset preview, 
```{python}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| message: false
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
# Dataset
```{python}
data = pd.read_csv("data/bmw_worldwide_sales.csv")
data.head(10)
```
# Dataset Overview
```{python,  label= dataset-summary,message =false,echo= false }
data.describe()
```
The dataset contains key attributes that represent performance indicators such as price and sales volume.
The presence of attributes like Engine_Size_L, Fuel_Type, and Transmission makes it ideal for visualization and regression modeling.

# Example Explorations
## BMW Sales by Model and Region
```{python, labe= hist-targets, fig-cap = "BMW Sales Volume by Model and Region", fig-align =center, echo: false}
region_model_sales = data.groupby(["Region", "Model"])["Sales_Volume"].sum().reset_index()
pivot_region_model = region_model_sales.pivot(index="Region", columns="Model", values="Sales_Volume").fillna(0)
pivot_region_model.plot(kind="bar", stacked=True, figsize=(10,6), colormap="coolwarm")
plt.title("BMW Sales by Model and Region", fontsize=14, weight="bold")
plt.xlabel("Region")
plt.ylabel("Sales Volume")
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.legend(title="Model", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05,1))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
# Engine Size vs. Sales Volume
```{python}
#| label: engine-vs-sales
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Engine Size and Sales Volume by Region"
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x="Engine_Size_L", y="Sales_Volume", hue="Region", s=70)
plt.title("Engine Size vs. Sales Volume by Region", fontsize=14, weight="bold")
plt.xlabel("Engine Size (L)")
plt.ylabel("Sales Volume")
plt.grid(True, linestyle="--", alpha=0.6)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
